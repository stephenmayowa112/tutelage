# Alternative Deployment Instructions

## Option 1: Pre-built CSS (Recommended)
Your CSS is already built and minified. Simply deploy without any build process.

### Vercel Settings:
- **Framework Preset**: Other/Static
- **Build Command**: Leave empty or `echo "Static deployment"`
- **Install Command**: Leave empty
- **Output Directory**: `.` (root)

## Option 2: Manual Build and Deploy
1. Build locally: `npm run build:css`
2. Drag and drop the folder to Vercel dashboard
3. No build commands needed

## Option 3: GitHub Pages
1. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
2. Set source to root directory
3. No build process needed since CSS is pre-built

## Current Status
✅ CSS is built and minified (21KB)
✅ Images are optimized
✅ HTML is optimized with performance features
✅ JavaScript is deferred for faster loading

## Files Ready for Deployment
- All HTML files
- Pre-built CSS in `/css/style.css`
- Optimized images in `/images/`
- JavaScript files in `/js/`
